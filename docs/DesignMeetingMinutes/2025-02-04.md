  * We had a lengthy discussion about @llvm-beanz's dislike of the "flat" term.

## Other Discussion

* Effects Syntax support in HLSL 202x
  * We have an issue to turn effects syntax usage into errors in HLSL 202x - https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/380
  * This will potentially cause some source breakage for codebases that are shared between DX 10/11 and DX 12.
  * There is at least one known case where DXC assumes valid C++11 syntax is an effects annotation (https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7111).
  * Today, DXC ignores the effects annotation, which seems to users to be ignoring a valid intializer.
  * This syntax is C++11 initialization syntax that is not intended to be supported in DXC (which is C++98-based), but will be supported in Clang.
  * Proposed Solution:
    * In DXC: Make all effects syntax parsing errors in HLSL 202x mode.
    * In Clang: Make any effects-like syntax that is valid in modern C++ warn that it is a 202y extension.
