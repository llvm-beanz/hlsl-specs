\p Expressions are classified by the type(s) of values they produce. The valid
types of values produced by expressions are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item An \textit{lvalue} represents a function or object.
  \item An \textit{rvalue} represents a temporary object.
  \item An \textit{xvalue} (expiring value) represents an object near the end
  of its lifetime.
  \item A \textit{cxvalue} (casted expiring value) is an \textit{xvalue}
  which, on expiration, assigns its value to a bound \textit{lvalue}.
  \item A \textit{glvalue} is an \textit{lvalue}, \textit{xvalue}, or
  \textit{cxvalue}.
  \item A \textit{prvalue} is an \textit{rvalue} that is not an \textit{xvalue}.
\end{enumerate}
